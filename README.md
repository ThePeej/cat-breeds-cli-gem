# CatBreeds

A simple command line interface gem that scrapes a website and provides information on cat breeds to the user.

## Installation

```ruby
gem install cat_breeds
```

## Usage

Type the command below to start the cat_breeds CLI and start exploring the many amazing breeds of cats!

    $ cat-breeds

Select a cat from the main menu by entering either its breed name or menu number. Once you've selected a cat breed, you will be able to select further details to learn more about that breed. When you select a specific category, you can either go back and look into another category for that same cat breed, or you can go back to the home menu and learn about a different cat breed. Enter exit at any point while using cat_breeds to close out of the gem CLI.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
