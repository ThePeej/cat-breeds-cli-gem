From there, the user continues to use the CLI to learn about more details of the selected cat breed.

- [X] Pull data from an external source - Data is pulled from the index page (http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/breeds), and then data is pulled from each individual page of each breed (i.e. http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/abyssinian)
